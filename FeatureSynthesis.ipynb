    "The goal here is to generate a bunch of features using a class called FeatureSynth. The interface for this class should be as follows:\n",
    "* User initializes the class with their training data.\n",
    "     * User specifies which columns of the training data are categorical, DateTime, numerical, etc.\n",
    "     * /*User specifies how they want the cluster analysis to be performed. This may be by directly passing in a clustering function to fit, or it could be by passing an indicator variable that will indicate which clustering function to use.*/\n",
    "     * User specifies picture size, with not only number of pixels, but also number of channels. This only works for generating square images, so that must be checked by the program. ```total_number_of_features = number_of_pixels * number_of_channels```, so ```num_synth_feats = total_number_of_features - number_of_input_features```.\n",
    "* User calls function ```synthesize_features()```\n",
